<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Matt and would like to thank you for visiting my personal website. I have recently started
     to learn web development and am keen to show my progress on this site but first let me 
    tell you a little about myself and why I have started learning this fascinating subject.</p>

<p>I grew up in Hastings and have always loved the outdoors whether that was just walking my 
    dog in the woods or spending the entire weekend fishing and because of this plus my keen
    interest in building and creating things I naturally was drawn to a career in the construction
    insustry where i worked as a carpenter for 20 years. 
    I thoroghly enjoyed this but as I'm getting older I've become keen to challenge myself in 
    a different way. This led me to programming as in many ways it is similar to carpentry  
    as you are taking ideas and plans from clients and using tools plus some creativity 
    to create what the client is after. Although it's similar it's the differences that excite 
    me the most and am very excited to get the skills required to contribute and bring to life 
    amazing websites that integrate the future of tech like AI, blockchain and web3.</p>

<p>I beleive I also have developed many transferrable skills as a carpenter over the years as I 
    would have to meet clients in their own home to discuss their requirements, liase with them
    throughout the entire project from quote stage up to completion. This could mean spending 
    many months in their home and causing great disruption so I have developed great skills in 
    communication and setting expectations (for example, when fitting a kitchen you have to 
    emphasise just how disruptive it can be as not only will the work be dusty and there be no
    where for them to prepare food but also the new kitchen will often need to be stored in a 
    space thay would normally be used for other activities like the living room. As long as 
    you have communicated this clearly and they are prepared for it then there is far less 
    chance of the client getting frustrated). More job specific skills were collaberating with 
    other trades to keep the project on time (For example, Loft conversoins would require many
    trades from carpenters, roofers, plumbers, electricians, plasterers and decorators and I 
    would be the one to make sure they were scheduled in and the job was ready for when they 
    arrived), problem solving skills were regularly tested as 
    you never know what you will be uncovering when you start taking apart properties and an 
    eye for detail as people demand quality when they are spending their life savings on a 
    project as large as a loft conversion or a full kitchen refit.</p>

<p>Going forward I am keen to start a career in the industry, it is very early days but I have 
    a basic road map of how I'm going to get there and this will include completing the Udemy 
    course I have enrolled on which is a full stack development course teaching HTML, CSS and 
    Javascript with plenty of small projects scattered in there. Once this is complete I will be
    keen to start building my own websites, mainly just for fun but I may find a deeper purpose 
    in one of these and start my own business. Here's to an exciting future.</p>
